This is a [Flysystem adapter](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem) for [Cloudinary API](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/php_integration).

# Installation

```bash
composer require enl/flysystem-cloudinary dev-master
```

# Bootstrap

``` php
<?php
use Enl\Flysystem\Cloudinary\ApiFacade as CloudinaryClient;
use Enl\Flysystem\Cloudinary\CloudinaryAdapter;
use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;

include __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new CloudinaryClient([
    'cloud_name' => 'your-cloudname-here',
    'api_key' => 'api-key',
    'api_secret' => 'You-know-what-to-do',
    'overwrite' => false, // set this to true if you want to overwrite existing files using $filesystem->write();
]);

$adapter = new CloudinaryAdapter($client);
```

# Cloudinary features

Please, keep in mind three possible pain-in-asses of Cloudinary:
 
* It adds automatically file extension to its public_id. In terms of Flysystem, cloudinary's public_id is considered as filename. But if you set public_id as 'test.jpg' Cloudinary will save the file as 'test.jpg.jpg'
* It does not support folders creation through the API
* If you want to save your files using folder you should set public_ids like 'test/test.jpg' and allow automated folders creation in your account settings in Cloudinary dashboard.

# Disclaimer

Actually, this library is very UNSTABLE. I haven't yet integrated it in project I've developed it for.

By the way, there is a bunch of tests which gives me hope:)
